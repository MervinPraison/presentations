  // Ensure that test "clean up" is
  // deferred  until after the test body
  // executes. `Test#add_cleanup` cannot
  // be used for this purpose because
  // the operation is asynchronous, and
  // `add_cleanup` does not support
  // asynchronous operations at the time
  // of this writing. See
  // https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/6075
  // Ensure also that test failure is
  // not hidden by successful cleanup

    .then(cleanup, cleanup)
    .then(function() {
        return test_body;
      });
});
```

???

This is an asynchronous version of `try`/`finally`.

It could be expressed more concisely with an `async` function or with
`Promise.prototype.finally`.

We had a goal to make these tests as accessible as possible, so neither of
these were viable options.

# The process

1. Write some code
2. Use the new code to run *all of WPT* in Chromium's build system
3. Identify new failures in the web platform tests
4. Investigate what change to the test harness triggered the failures--these
   are regressions

--

Why Chromium? Why all of WPT?

# No Tests.

???

Prior to this project, WPT's test harness was essentially untested.

It included a handful of manual tests, but a manual test is no more resilient
to rot than documentation.

We essentially used all of WPT as a test suite.

The Servo browser presented another challenge.

Servo is the experimental browser that was started at Mozilla.

It also runs WPT, and it had a unique deficiency.

--

![No Promises in Servo](img/comments/servo-no-promises.png)

???

It would be easy to change the test harness in a way that made it impossible
for Servo to run WPT.

We wanted to avoid this, so we took on an additional constraint: we would only
use the `Promise` API if the current test already involved promises.

# Diagnosing failures

- **Behavioral regressions (my fault)**
- Test bugs (someone else's fault)
- Implementation bugs (someone else's fault)

???

Since we were vetting correctness by using the web platform tests themselves,
even just diagnosing failures was a challenge.

Reports wouldn't describe test harness regressions directly; instead, they
appeared to highlight browser implementation errors.

Those failures fell into 3 basic categories.

While it's easy to assign blame, it doesn't matter whose "fault" it was.

All of the failures were my problem.

---

### Behavioral regressions

Expected scheduling behavior:

    Task | Microtask | Synchronous steps
    1    | 1         | test() ---------> { /*body*/ } --> testharness complete
    2    | 1         |                                                          (uncaught exceptions)

    Task | Microtask | Synchronous steps
    1    | 1         | promise_test()
    1    | 2         |        `--------> { return p; }
    1    | 3         |                        `---------> testharness complete
    2    | 1         |                                                          (uncaught exceptions)

Regression:

    Task | Microtask | Synchronous steps
    1    | 1         | promise_test()
    1    | 2         |        `--------> { return p; }
    2    | 1         |                        |         (uncaught exceptions)
    3    | 1         |                        `-------------------------------> testharness complete

???

One particularly challenging issue concerned the event loop, tasks, and
microtasks.

The initial version of the patch identified a number of tests with uncaught
exceptions.

It was tempting to call this an improvement, but we ultimately decided that
ignoring these types of exceptions was an undocumented feature of the test
harness.

---

### Behavioral regressions

Existing usages of `add_cleanup`

- [gh-8742: Do not return value from "cleanup" functions](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/8742)
- [gh-11733: [fullscreen] Do not return value from cleanup fns](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/11733)
- [gh-11740: [html] Do not return value from cleanup fns](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/11740)
- [gh-11741: [fetch] Do not return value from cleanup fns](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/11741)
- [chromium-1109513: Make add_cleanup step in no-inherit-type.html return undefined](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1109513) (thanks, Philip!)

???

Plenty of tests were already using `add_cleanup`, which was just fine by us.

However, some of them returned a value

Even though doing so had no effect, this was a concern for two reasons:

1. The patch made it an error for a test to return a non-promise value. This
   would help authors avoid making mistakes (e.g. `return foo` instead of
   `return foo()`), but it was also a new restriction, so we were responsible
   for integrating it.
2. Tests that happened to return promise values would suddenly start to behave
   differently after the patch was landed. We didn't want to introduce any
   behavior changes to existing tests, since it would be hard for the tests'
   maintainers to recognize cases where this was a problem

This was generally straightforward.

However, fixing even just one test can take quite a lot of work.

This review involved six people and ran for just over 3 months.

```

???

Chromium's "test expectations" files for WPT hard-code the line number on which
the assertions are defined.

That line number is not considered "stable" by WPT.

Most changes to the test harness naturally change the location of the
surrounding code.

# Unanticipated benefits

Testing the test harness

???

This ended up being more important to me than the feature itself.

By mid-June, it was the reason I was still pushing for (and to) the patch.

Now any change can be vetted for regressions in a matter of seconds (not
		hours).

When failures occur, they are expressed in terms of the test harness's
capabilities (not some arbitrary web platform feature).

It'd be ironic for me to call this project finished when there was still work
to do.

The Service Workers still use that confusing pattern, so I've been working to
integrate this feature.

The hardest part is going to be finding someone to review all this!
