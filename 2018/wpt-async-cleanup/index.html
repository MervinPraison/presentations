This is an asynchronous version of `try`/`finally`.

It coulp be expressed more concisely with an `async` function or with
`Promise.prototype.finally`.

We had a goal to make these tests as accessible as possible, so neither of
these were viable options.

### Behavioral regressions

???

Plenty of tests were already using `add_cleanup`, which was just fine by us.

However, some of them returned a value

Even though doing so had no effect, this was a concern for two reasons:

1. The patch made it an error for a test to return a non-promise value. This
   would help authors avoid making mistakes (e.g. `return foo` instead of
   `return foo()`), but it was also a new restriction, so we were responsible
   for integrating it.
2. Tests that happened to return promise values would suddenly start to behave
   differently after the patch was landed. We didn't want to introduce any
   behavior changes to existing tests, since it would be hard for the tests'
   maintainers to recognize cases where this was a problem

However, fixing even just one test can take quite a lot of work.

This review involved six people and ran for just over 3 months.

### Test bugs

Unhandled promise rejections

  } finally {
    // This runs thousands of times, causing the console to spew "Uncaught

![IRC log discussing known flakiness in Chromium](img/comments/chromium-flakiness.png)

### Implementation bugs

Brittle expectations files

`chromium / src / third_party / WebKit / LayoutTests / fast / dom / custom / svg-use-shadow-tree-expected.txt`

```

```

???

Chromium's "test expectations" files for WPT hard-code the line number on which
the assertions are defined.

That line number is not considered "stable" by WPT.

Most changes to the test harness naturally change the location of the
surrounding code.

This ended up being more important to me than the feature itself.

By mid-June, it was the reason I was still pushing for (and to) the patch.
