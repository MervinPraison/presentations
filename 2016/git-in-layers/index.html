# Git in Layers

## Why git?

Industry.

![](vcs-job-trends.png)


???

git is becoming more and more important in the software development industry.

This is only so compelling, though. Many of us are motivated by factors beyond
employment and making money.

---

- Why git?
  - It's becoming more and more important in the software development industry
  - It's becoming more and more important for open source software
  - It's powerful and fast
- What about GUIs?
  - They're great, but they're no substitute for understanding

---

## Patches

  - A description of change
  - Context: sofware collaboration
    - We have the same copy of a project
    - I make a small change to my copy
    - I send you *all the files*, even though 99% is the same. I explain what
      I've changed in detail
    - You take my word for it
  - Enter Larry Wall
  - History: Larry Wall (author of Perl and patch), Apache, etc.
  - Look ma, no git (using `diff` and `patch` on a \*nix system)
  - Takeaway: the *file* is the *change*

---

## Commits

  - A patch works for a one-off fix, but we should expect to make many, many
    changes over time
  - We could try to manage this on our own, but things would get out of hand
    quickly
  - *In git terms*, a **commit** is a patch that references the patch that came
    before it (the **parent**). It also has a bunch of meta-data like a
    description of the patch, the time the patch was created, and the patch
    author's name. (`git show`)
  - By maintaining a "commit history", git allows us to review how the project
    has changed over time (`git log`)
  - ...and even rewind history and return the project to a prior state (`git
    checkout`)
  - Takeaway: the changes may be stacked

## Branches
  - This would all work perfectly if we knew, in advance, everything we had to
    do and exactly how we would do it.
  - In the real world, this is rarely the case
  - Sometimes, we need to experiment with an idea without fowling up the "real"
    version of the project
  - ...and sometimes, we'd like to work on two separate features at the same
    time
  - We've already seen how commit histories let us store prior versions of our
    project, but these use cases call for a slightly different ability. We'd
    need to maintain multiple actively-developed states
  - Up until now, we've been thinking of git's "history" just like the
    plain-English definition: a linear sequence of events (commits in this
    case)
  - Really, though, git organizes commits in the form of a "graph." That word 
    has a formal definition in Computer Science terms, but effectively, it
    means that multiple commits can have the same parent
  - Whenever this occurs, we label the divergence as a "branch"
  - Once you wrap your head around the idea of a whole *graph* of commits, the
    concept of a "branch" is natural
  - *In git terms*, a **branch** is just a commit with a name
  - Takeaway: we can build divergent histories by piling changes in different
    stacks

---

## Remotes

  - At this point, we've seen all the fundamental primitives that make up a
    git project. Combined, the are known as a **repository**
  - *In git terms*, a **repository** is a collection of source files along with
    a commit graph
  - Git is known as a "distributed version control system" because it was
    designed to support concurrent development across multiple computers, any
    of which may be offline
  - *In git terms*, a **remote** is a parallel version of an entire repository
  - In order to contribute to a project, you begin by "cloning" the repository
    to your local machine. It's called "cloning" because at that moment, the
    commit graph on your computer is identical to the one on the remote
    repository
