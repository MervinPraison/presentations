## Why git? (1/3)

Industry.

![Trends in job postings mentioning specific version control
systems](img/vcs-job-trends.png)

???

git is becoming more and more important in the software development industry.

This is only so compelling, though. Many of us are motivated by factors beyond
employment and making money.

---

## Why git? (2/3)

Open source software.

![](img/vcs-usage-2010-2013.png)

???

It's becoming more and more important for open source software

---

## Why git? (3/3)

It's both powerful and fast.

## What about GUIs?

## What about GUIs?

> We want GUIs largely because they are convenient and because they are
> easy--or at least the GUI makes it seem that way. Of course, nothing is
> really easy and simple, and putting a nice interface on top of it does not
> change that fact.

Neil Stephenson, *In the Beginning... Was the Command Line* (1999)

???

In other words, GUIs are great, but they're no substitute for understanding.
I'm hopeful that this talk can help you understand the fundamentals so that you
can use git effectively, regardless of the interface.

### Patches

Context: sofware collaboration

1. We have the same copy of a project
2. I make a small change to my copy
3. I send you *all the source files* (even though 99% are identical). I explain
   what I've changed in detail
4. You take my word for it

---
class: center middle

### Patches

.journal[
  ![](img/patches-journal-1.png)
  ![](img/patches-journal-2.png)
]

```
$ diff journal.md journal-2.md 
5c5
< I had cereal for breakfast.
---
> I had eggs for breakfast.
7a8,9
> 
> I read an issue of *Sandman* before falling to sleep.
$ 
```

???

Developers built tools to help analyze modifications in text files. This
example demonstrates the Unix `diff` tool.

---

### Patches

New collaboration workflow:

1. We have the same copy of a project
2. I make a small change to my copy
3. I send you ~~*all the source files* (even though 99% are identical). I
   explain what I've changed in detail~~ a patch file
4. You ~~take my word for it~~ review my changes and apply them using `patch`

???

These change summaries, sometimes called **diffs** or **deltas**, could be
saved to a file and shared directly. A **patch** is a file containing a change
set.

### Patches

.journal[

]

```
$ patch journal.md journal.patch
patching file journal.md
$ cat journal.md 
# My journal
​
Today was a nice day.
​
I had eggs for breakfast.
​
I went to bed at 23:45.
​
I read an issue of *Sandman* before falling to sleep.
$ 
```

???

Here's what that might look like.

- A patch works for a one-off fix, but we should expect to make many, many
  changes over time
- We could try to manage this on our own, but things would get out of hand
  quickly

### Commits

*In git terms*, a **commit** is a patch that references the patch that came
before it (the **parent**). It also has a bunch of meta-data like a description
of the patch, the time the patch was created, and the patch author's name.

```

### Commits

By maintaining a "commit history", git allows us to review how the project has
changed over time

![](img/menu-hist-03.png)

???

This structure even lets us rewind history and return the project to a prior
state.

Takeaway: changes can be *stacked*

- This would all work perfectly if we knew, in advance, everything we had to
  do and exactly how we would do it.
- In the real world, this is rarely the case
- Sometimes, we need to experiment with an idea without fowling up the "real"
  version of the project
- ...and sometimes, we'd like to work on two separate features at the same
  time
- We've already seen how commit histories let us store prior versions of our
  project, but these use cases call for a slightly different ability. We'd
  need to maintain multiple actively-developed states

---
background-image: url("img/history-short.svg")

### Branches

???

Up until now, we've been thinking of git's "history" just like the
plain-English definition: a linear sequence of events (commits in this case)

---
background-image: url("img/history-long-linear.svg")

### Branches

???

???

It doesn't take too much imagination to see how this could support a
long-running project. More commits--longer history.

---
background-image: url("img/history-long-branches.svg")

### Branches

???

Really, though, git organizes commits in the form of a "graph." That word has a
formal definition in Computer Science terms, but effectively, it means that
multiple commits can have the same parent

---
background-image: url("img/history-long-branches-named.svg")

### Branches

???

Whenever this occurs, we label the divergence as a "branch"

Once you wrap your head around the idea of a whole *graph* of commits, the
concept of a "branch" is natural

*In git terms*, a **branch** is just a commit with a name

---
class: center middle

### Branches

![](img/menu-02.png)

???

This is a bit abstract, though, so lets return to the sandwhich shop example.

---
class: center middle

### Branches

![](img/menu-02-branch.png)

???

Let's say that one day, we decide to offer a brand new sandwhich. We could add
it to the menu and make a commit for that.

---
class: center

### Branches

![](img/menu-02-01.png)

???

But at the same time, maybe in a separate shop, we want to flex our marketing
abilities and advertise with a brand new slogan.

We could make a new branch from the original state (the one without the new
sandwhich) and add a commit with the new slogan.

--

![](img/menu-02-02.png)

???

...and maybe after a few days, we find that the wording is a bit too strong. We
can add another commit to fix that.

---
class: center middle

### Branches

![](img/menu-03.png)

???

After a few weeks, we're confident that the new sandwhich is a hit *and* that
the slogan is effective. We can **merge** the two branches, resulting in a
menu that has both improvements.

---

### Branches

```
$ git log --graph --oneline
​* d9bd7b6 Remove "new" from description
​* 2e42fcf Merge branch 'new-sandwhich'
​|\  
​| * 8daea81 Introduce new sandwich
​* | 70d348b Amend slogan
​* | 3171c8d Add slogan
​|/  
​* 576c281 Adjust for sales tax
​* da61ed8 Raise price of PB&J
​* 5f8ba1a Initial commit
$ 
```

???

All this--the changes, the time they were made, and even the fact that they
occurred in separate tracks--is captured in the project history.

git does its best to desribe this in a text-based form, but it's admittedly a
little hard to read. Reviewing commit history is a case where GUI tools can
really shine.

---
class: center middle takeaway

### Branches

![](img/diagram-03-branch.svg)

Takeaway: we can build divergent histories by piling changes in different
stacks

### Remotes

![](img/diagram-04-repository.svg)

*In git terms*, a **repository** is a collection of source files along with a
commit graph

???

At this point, we've seen all the fundamental primitives that make up a git
project. Combined, the are known as a **repository**

---

### Remotes

![](img/diagram-05-remote.svg)

*In git terms*, a **remote** is a parallel version of an entire repository

???

Git is known as a "distributed version control system" because it was designed
to support concurrent development across multiple computers, any of which may
be offline.

---
class: center middle

### Remotes

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jugglinmike/sandwich-shop.git
Cloning into 'sandwich-shop'...
remote: Counting objects: 62, done.
remote: Total 62 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 62
Receiving objects: 100% (62/62), 199.97 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (10/10), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
$
```

???

In order to contribute to a project, you begin by "cloning" the repository to
your local machine. It's called "cloning" because at that moment, the commit
graph on your computer is identical to the one on the remote repository.
