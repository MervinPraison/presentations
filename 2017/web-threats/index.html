**zero-rating** - the practice of ISPs and mobile providers choosing not to
count certain content toward users’ data limits, often in exchange for capping
the speeds at which customers can access that content.

> Today, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau is closing its investigation
> into wireless carriers’ free-data offerings. These free-data plans have proven
> to be popular among consumers, particularly low-income Americans, and have
> enhanced competition in the wireless marketplace. Going forward, the Federal
> Communications Commission will not focus on denying Americans free data.
> Instead, we will concentrate on expanding broadband deployment and encouraging
> innovative service offerings.

- Ajit Pai, chairman US FCC, February 3, 2017
